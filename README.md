# Cloudy Engine

Cloudy Engine is a simple light-weight modular Discord bot that uses [discord.js](https://discord.js.org/) library as interface.

This engine is designed to help develop commands and other functionalities in the form of plugins.

## Configuration file

The configuration file is an auto generated JSON file stored in the directory root.
It contains the client token, plugins directory path, command prefix and shards count.

Here is an example of the file

```json
{
  "token":"GC3M_th1s_MjMzMDQ2_15_3.f_4_LzOA.hnQz_f4k3_9c9StZ2Lda_t0k3n_S5t4kE",
  "plugins_dir": "bot_plugins",
  "command_prefix": "!",
  "shards": "3"
}
```
